## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance all had significantly small pr(>|t|) values. That means they are more likely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slop is not zero because the p-value is significantly smaller than the significance level of 0.05%. Meaning that we can't reject the null hypothesis.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
I don't think that this model predicts the mpg effectively because the r-squared value is at 0.71. I think that the model is either missing a significant variable, or there's too many variables.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
